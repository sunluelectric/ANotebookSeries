\chapter{Applications}

Two examples are given in this section for partial differential and multiple integral applications respectively. 

Section \ref{ch8sec:nnbackpropagation} introduces back-propagation for a conventional multi-layer perceptrons artificial neural network. Back-propagation is a key procedure where the neural network ``learns'' from labeled training samples for pattern recognition. 

Section \ref{ch8sec:bayesianinference} introduces Bayesian inference, a widely used method for updating the probability of a hypothesis using Bayes theorem.
